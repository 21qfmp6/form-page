      <h3>OUR COMMUNITY</h3>
      <p>We are deeply rooted in Prince Edward County. We live just up the road at Edwin County Farms where we grow and harvest many of the organic ingredients we serve in our restaurants. Our farm-to-table ethos extends throughout the hotel, encompassing our rich community of artisans and producers, friends whose talent, passion and hard work are woven throughout everything we do. Our commitment to sustainably supporting this land and its people is what drives our sense of purpose..</p>
